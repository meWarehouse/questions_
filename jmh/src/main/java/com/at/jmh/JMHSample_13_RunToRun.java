     *
     * Note the baseline is random within [0..1000] msec; and both forked runs
     * are estimating the average 500 msec with some confidence.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_13 -wi 0 -i 3
     *    (we requested no warmup, 3 measurement iterations; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
